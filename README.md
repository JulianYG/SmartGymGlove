# SmartGymGlove

A pair of gym gloves with pressure sensors and accelerometers. They can detect the exercise user doing, with detailed information such as form correctness, weight on body and lapsed time. These data are sent back to their smart phone through a bluetooth app and used for work-out plan/effect analysis.
